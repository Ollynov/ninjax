## Branding

- Each Starter pack has some image at the top, perhaps a deck of cards with each card being one of the tech pieces. For example MERN, one card for Mongo, one for express, etc. Inspiration here is pokemon cards with "starter packs". You can get someone from Fiverr to build this for you. The more important thing here is for the consistency in the images, another thing that will quickly allow someone to see whether somethbing is an official starter pack or not.
