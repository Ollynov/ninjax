## Branding

- Each Starter pack has some image at the top, perhaps a deck of cards with each card being one of the tech pieces. For example MERN, one card for Mongo, one for express, etc. Inspiration here is pokemon cards with "starter packs". You can get someone from Fiverr to build this for you. The more important thing here is for the consistency in the images, another thing that will quickly allow someone to see whether somethbing is an official starter pack or not. 

## Have a "Core Supporters" section in addtion to the Core Sponsors and Core Contributors section

- The Core Supporters will be a way to get some eyeballs onto your framework in the early stages. These will be well known developers in the open source community who simply tweet or mention your framework a couple of times. Perhaps they can become part of the "org" on github and it will be on their profiles. They really don't have to do much other than support the cause, and they can also be a part of the core supporters by providing feedback and thoughs on how the readme is structured. Probably can even meet a lot of them over coffee in SF. Can be very frank and straightforward with them, even with the initial message sent to them. 
- Core sponsors will be for the future when looking to make some money
- Core Contributors will simply be the ones sending in the greatest amount of PRs (greatest contribution of starter packs and boosters)

## Have some boosters and starters that are the official or 'recommended' ones

- Still undecided here, needs some thought. 
- Could give rise to some potential business models.

## In the future can create "Ninjax Library" which would be alternative to npm.

- One of the benefits here is that you can more clearly distinguish 'official' starters and boosters from the open community ones. 

## Get logo made on Fiver

## Consider removing the example of 'smaller' boosters such as buttons

- This really isn't the most common use case. There may be sometimes that we have smaller boosters such as buttons, but that's really not the point. So perhaps not even worth mentioning because it may confuse people.
