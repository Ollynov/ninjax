## What is NinjaX? 

There are two parts to NinjaX:

1. A library of pre-built code components that help you build apps faster. The library is open source and supported through a community, but has a pre-defined criteria for submitting new components. 

2. A command line tool that injects code directly into your app. This is similar to npm, but instead of delivering pre-packaged components that are ready to use (and hidden in node-modules folder), Ninjax injects the full source code directly into your app, so you can more easily customize it and understand how it is integrated.

It is possible to use NinjaX components without the command line tool, but it is not possible to use to command line tool on a repo that is not specifically a NinjaX repo. In other words you can use #1 without #2, but not #2 without #1. However, we recommend using both, as the command line tool helps set up your NinjaX repo correctly, and integrates your boosters into your app. 

The NinjaX development process begins by downloading a "starter pack", and later adding boosters into your repo, which are specifically designed for that particular starter pack. As you develop, you are also free to add npm packages alongside your NinjaX boosters, as they are not the same thing, and virtually every app should have both. On a "scale of abstraction" you can imagine it like this:
