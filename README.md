## What is NinjaX? 

There are two parts to NinjaX:

1. A library of pre-built code components that help you build apps faster. The library is open source and supported through a community, but has a pre-defined criteria for submitting new components. 

2. A command line tool that injects code directly into your app. This is similar to mpm, but instead of delivered pre-packaged components that are ready to use (and hidden in node-modules folder) the full source code injects directly into your app, so you can more easily customize it and learn how it is integrated.

## What is a "booster"?
